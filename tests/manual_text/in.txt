if bit 3 is ‘1’ and bit 4 is ‘0’ then the parity bit is transmitted and checked as ‘1’.
Signal AWUSER_WIDTH must be greater than or equal to 1.
A value of 1 on Signal RDATA valid byte lines is not permitted when Signal RVALID is HIGH.
When Signal AWVALID is asserted then it remains high until Signal AWREADY is high.
A value of 0 on Signal AWID is not permitted when Signal AWVALID is HIGH
Signal AWVALID is LOW for the first cycle after Signal ARESTEn goes high
When Signal AWVALID is high and Signal AWCACHE[1] is LOW then Signal AWCACHE[3:2] are also LOW
Signal AWID must remain stable when Signal AWVALID is asserted and Signal AWREADY is LOW
